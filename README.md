Development for Building a Programming Language class.

While as an actual submission this is wildly disappointing (it does not contain
the report or any of the optional extensions), I do hope the solutions to the
exercises as given are sufficient.

Notes:

- While each exercise has its own named commit, I didn't begin the work in git,
  but in successive copy-pasted files that got larger and larger. As such, most
  of the commits show changes due both to the exercise itself, and to the lecture
  material leading up to it. I have mostly annotated exercise-specific changes
  with the comment `-- [Ex]`. I hope this gives you some measure of guidance in
  what to look at (sorry!).

  The last weeks material has dedicated commits for lecture material and exercises.
